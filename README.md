## Description
```
My project is an expression of my favorite hobby...painting furniture and making it feel NEW.  This project is a personal website displaying furniture I have painted as well as furniture still on my 'to-paint' list.  To view, open the index.html file.  
- Home Page:  (index.html) includes an Images link in navbar.  It also includes the following links that are under construction:  About, Contact, Sign up for our Newsletter!.

Objectives: 
 - responsive
 - 3 custom CSS class or ID selectors (see ## Customer CSS Classes below)
 - Commenting Sections
 - Uploaded project to GitHub repository
 - README file (you're reading it!!)

```


## Custom CSS Classes
```
The class(es) I created are:

1. .store_name
..changes the font-family to tangerine, made the font bold, and changed font-size to 5em

2. .linkedIn
..transforms the text to white when the linkedIn link is hovered over

3. .footer_name
..Changing the size of the company name in footer

```



## Custom JavaScript Functions
```
The javascript functions I created are:

1. $(".dialog").click(function(event){
    $("#dialogbox").dialog
.. This function adds a dialog box to the links on the page that are under construction.

```
